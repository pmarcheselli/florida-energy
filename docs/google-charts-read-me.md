### Line Charts

Google Charts scripts were chosen to visualize the data for Energy Consumption in Florida and Renewable Energy in Florida for the Florida Energy Systems Consortium website (FESC) redesign. For both charts, line charts were chosen as the data types (string and number) were the same for both types of data. Furthermore, line charts were a good choice to easily visualize the increase/decrease of consumption and renewable energy production.
