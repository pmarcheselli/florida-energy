### Objective of Redesign

[!NOTE]

The Florida Energy Systems Consortium website (FESC) was created by the Florida State government to promote collaboration among the energy experts at its 12 supported universities to share energy-related expertise. The website is meant to be an information-driven resource with plenty of links for all intended users. 

The objective of this redesign is to strategize better handling of large amounts of information, links, and resources to make it easier for intended users to access and use. The final product will yield a website that is easily navigable and information is presented in an organized fashion.
