# Florida Energy Systems Consortium

## Website Redesign Proposal

(http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/)

### A. Objective of Redesign

The Florida Energy Systems Consortium website (FESC) was created by the Florida State government to promote collaboration among the energy experts at its 12 supported universities to share energy-related expertise. The website is meant to be an information-driven resource with plenty of links for all intended users. 

The objective of this redesign is to strategize better handling of large amounts of information, links, and resources to make it easier for intended users to access and use. The final product will yield a website that is easily navigable and information is presented in an organized fashion. 

### B. State of the Current Site

  #### 1. Accessibility audit
  Using ResponsiveDesignChecker.org, FESC’s performance was tested on various desktop sizes. On a 1920x1600 resolution, the FESC site’s navbar and footer are properly sized, however, all aside and main body content display off center and too small. On a smaller laptop screen size of 1024x600 resolution, the site’s content displays off screen and one must scroll or swipe to the sides to access content. On a mobile phone screen of 414x736 and smaller at 320x568 resolution, FESC displays completely off center and various integral site elements are inaccessible. Furthermore, the site needs to be redesigned to be accessible on various platforms. 
     
  #### 2. Mobile friendliness
  Currently, FESC is not mobile and is extremely difficult to navigate on a mobile device and does not meet industry standards. Google’s Mobile-Friendly test was used and found the page to be difficult to use on a mobile device. Furthermore, Google found that the clickable elements are too close together, viewport not set, text too small to read, and content wider than screen. 
        
  #### 3. Performance
  Webpagetest.org was used to test FESC, which loads in 4.491s. Images take up half of the load time followed by javascript. Research by Google has found that the average time it takes to fully load the average landing page is 22 seconds. However, research also indicates 53% of people will leave a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.
  
  #### 4. Functionality
  For the most part, FESC does work as intended. However, a quick click on the downloadable brochure on the homepage resulted in a 404 error.  A banner on the homepage displays outdated information that needs to be removed. 

  #### 5. Ease of Use
  FESC is not very easy to use as there are various links and large packets of text throughout the entire site. Information is not well presented making it very difficult to read. Once a user navigates into the navbar links to other landing pages, navigation becomes even more difficult as each new landing page displays a large aside with numerous links. Furthermore, a link on the navbar leads to a gallery of random images. Once the image is clicked into, it is very difficult to navigate out of the image.  The site’s contact information is not presented very nicely and has a Visit Us link that leads to another landing page with actual information. There is also a screenshot of a Google map showing how to access the FESC headquarters but there is no actual interactive Google Map. 
  
### C. User Research
Expected users of the Florida Energy Systems Consortium website are energy industry leaders, state and national government leaders, Florida universities, and individuals wanting to learn more about the energy industry in Florida.  Energy industry leaders would be accessing the site to gain more information and get in contact with universities doing energy research. National government leaders would access FESC to send press releases and news on laws and changes to energy regulations in Florida and nationwide. Florida universities would access FESC to send news and research on energy consumption, technology, and conferences related to FESC functions. These can be universities currently involved with FESC and other universities seeking involvement.  Additionally, individuals wanting to learn more about the energy industry in Florida would access FESC for news, statistics, energy conservation programs, and government regulations.  Overall, all users are accessing FESC for the purpose of obtaining information both on energy conservation and contact information for all those involved. It would be beneficial for FESC to be clearly navigable for all users to be able to obtain information, news, and contact info.  

### D. Device Support Necessary
The majority of expected users would most likely be accessing FESC during their work hours and most likely from their offices thus making the majority of FESC’s access via desktop computers. It would be beneficial for FESC to support a range of sizes - from a 24” display with a 1920x1200 resolution to a smaller 10” notebook with a 1024x600 and a range of browsers from Chrome, Mozilla, and Internet Explorer. Since mobile responsive sites are the industry standard nowadays, FESC would benefit from having a mobile responsive site that support Apple iPhone 5 to X and iOS 10 and 11 and the latest Android version on Samsung Galaxy S7 and Nexus 7.
